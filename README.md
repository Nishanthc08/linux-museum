# Linux Museum 🐧

An immersive, interactive web experience that teaches Linux concepts through storytelling, visual metaphors, and hands-on terminal practice.

## 🎯 Project Vision

The Linux Museum is a virtual museum where each "room" teaches specific Linux concepts through:

- **Interactive Storytelling**: Engaging narratives that explain the philosophy behind Linux
- **Visual Metaphors**: Complex concepts made accessible through intuitive visualizations
- **Terminal Emulation**: Real-time practice with command-line interfaces
- **Philosophical Context**: Understanding the "why" behind Linux design decisions

## 🏛️ Museum Rooms

### ✅ Completed Rooms

1. **The Hall of Origins** - Journey through Linux history and philosophy
2. **The Shell Chamber** - Interactive terminal learning with guided lessons
3. **The Filesystem Gallery** - Visual exploration of Linux directory structure

### 🚧 Planned Rooms

4. **The Kernel Core** - Deep dive into the heart of the operating system
5. **The Man Page Library** - Documentation and help system mastery
6. **The Daemon Dungeon** - Background processes and system services
7. **The Security Vault** - Permissions, users, and system security
8. **The Code Forge** - Development tools and programming environments

## 🚀 Getting Started

## 🐧 Philosophy

> "In the beginning was the Command Line" - Neal Stephenson

Linux represents more than just an operating system—it's a philosophy of:
- **Collaboration** over competition
- **Transparency** over secrecy
- **Merit** over politics
- **Innovation** over imitation

The Linux Museum aims to preserve and share this philosophy with new generations of users and developers.
